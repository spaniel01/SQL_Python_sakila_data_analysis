# Description

This project uses SQL and Python's SqlAlchemy to analyze the [sakila database](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/sakila/en/sakila-introduction.html) from the https://dev.mysql.com/ website and generate a report in Spyder. 

The project consists of the following steps, separated only for demonstration purposes (because one could obviously do everything direcly in Jupyter Notebook):

1. Analysis of database (DB) with SQL. The aim is only to show querying abilities. (DONE!)
2. Analysis of DB directly with Python's SQLAlchemy core. (DONE!)
3. Generate report in Jupyter Notebook. (UP NEXT!)
